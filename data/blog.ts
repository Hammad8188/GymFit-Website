      "Starting at the gym can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. Begin with 3 full-body sessions per week, focusing on form over weight. Compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows should form the foundation of your routine. Log your workouts, aim for progressive overload, and don't skip rest days. Within 4-6 weeks, you'll start seeing real results.",

      "For muscle building and recovery, aim for 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of bodyweight daily. Quality sources include chicken breast, eggs, Greek yogurt, fish, lentils, and whey protein. Spread your intake across 3-5 meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis. If you're cutting, increase to the higher end of the range to preserve lean mass.",

    excerpt: "Breaking down the pros and cons of each cardio method for fat loss.",
    content:
      "Both HIIT and steady-state cardio are effective for fat loss — the best choice depends on your schedule and preferences. HIIT burns more calories per minute and provides an afterburn effect (EPOC), but requires adequate recovery. Steady-state cardio is easier to recover from and can be done daily. A combination of both, 2-3 HIIT sessions and 2-3 steady-state sessions per week, is the gold standard approach.",

    excerpt: "How quality sleep impacts muscle recovery, fat loss, and performance.",
    content:
      "Growth hormone production peaks during deep sleep, making 7-9 hours crucial for muscle repair and growth. Poor sleep increases cortisol levels, leading to muscle breakdown and fat storage. Tips: maintain a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens 1 hour before bed, keep your room cool and dark, and limit caffeine after 2pm. Quality sleep is the most underrated performance enhancer.",
